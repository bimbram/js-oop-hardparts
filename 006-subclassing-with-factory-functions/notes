Slide01
-------
Interlude - We have another way of running a function that allow us to control the assignment of this

const obj = {
  num: 3,
  increment: function() {
    this.name++;
  }
}

const otherObj = {
  num: 10
}

obj.increment(); // obj.num now 4

obj.increment.call(otherObj) // otherObj.num now 11
// obj.increment.apply(otherObj)

this always refer to the left of the dot on whith the function (method) is being called, unless we override that running the function using .call() or .apply() which lets us set the value of this inside of the increment function
